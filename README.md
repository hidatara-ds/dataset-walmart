# ðŸ“Š Walmart Weekly Sales Forecasting

This project analyzes and predicts Walmart's weekly sales using various machine learning models. It focuses on evaluating model performance with and without feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## ðŸ§ª Experiments Conducted

- Baseline models with default parameters
- Feature importance extraction and selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Comparison of results before and after tuning

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

Performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²) were evaluated to determine the best-performing model. Files such as `model_evaluation_results_with_tuning.csv` summarize these outcomes.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hidatara-ds/dataset-walmart.git
   cd dataset-walmart
   ```
2. Open TTU2_revisi.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.


3. Run all cells to replicate results.



ðŸ“Œ Notes

The dataset used is a cleaned and prepared version of Walmartâ€™s weekly sales data.

The analysis focuses on performance comparisons across models and tuning techniques.
